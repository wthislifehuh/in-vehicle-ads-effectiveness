Y2 Assignment - Predict the effectiveness of in-vehicle ads

## Background
- In the realm of advertising and marketing, the effectiveness of in-vehicle radio advertisements has become a subject of increasing interest.
- With car radio being a common companion during commutes and drives, understanding the impact of promotional advertisements on drivers' behaviour is crucial for businesses seeking to optimize their marketing strategies. This project is driven by the need to assess whether drivers are likely to respond to these promotions by stopping at a local store.
- The central problem we aim to address in this project revolves around predicting the likelihood of car drivers stopping at a local store when they hear a promotional advertisement on their car radio while driving. This problem lies at the intersection of consumer behaviour and machine learning.
- Hence, the approach that would be implemented to tackle this problem is to build a classification model leveraging machine learning techniques to make predictions based on available data.
